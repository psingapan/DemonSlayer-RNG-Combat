--- DemonSlayer-RNG-Combat---

Demon Slayer is an RPG-combat game based on the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba series. It's a C# console application purely written to entertain your imagination of facing 
the demon slayer trio as a class 5 demon. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba is an anime series (on Netflix) that follows the story of a bold teenage boy named Tanjiro Kamado who dedicated
himself to demon slayer corps to avenge his family's death by finding a cure for his demon sister. Tanjiro is accompanied by two captivating demon slayers and his demon sister throughout
the journey of reaching Muzan.

The story of the game follows you. You are a class 5 demon that have pillaged your way through villages, unmerciful and relentless. You have not been challenged by anyone so you
continue to publicize your conquests up until now. You ravage a village and on the very last house you scoured, you sense a shift in the air...

Take aways:
- My very first self-written C# program! It's pretty basic but I am SO proud of it because I understood where my strengths and weaknesses lie.
- Had so much fun understanding how classes, inheritence, modifiers, and control flows actually work.
- Demon Slayer is the best.
